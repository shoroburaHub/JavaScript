    The Time Machine is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells, published in 1895. Wells is generally credited with the
    popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and
    selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used
    to refer to such a vehicle.

    The Time Machine has since been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television
    versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction
    in many media.
