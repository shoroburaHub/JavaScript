        The Time Machine is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells, published in 1895. Wells is generally credited with
        the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely
        and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost
        universally used to refer to such a vehicle.

        The Time Machine has since been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television
        versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of
        fiction in many media.

        Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled "The Chronic Argonauts" (1888).
        This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for The Time Machine.

        Wells frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the Pall
        Mall Gazette, until the publisher asked him if he could instead write a serial novel on the same theme. Wells
        readily agreed and was paid £100 (equal to about £10,000 today) on its publication by Heinemann in 1895, which
        first published the story in serial form in the January to May numbers of The New Review (newly under the
        nominal editorship of W. E. Henley).[1] Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly
        prepared from a different manuscript)[2] on 7 May 1895; Heinemann published an English edition on 29 May.[1]
        These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the "Holt text" and "Heinemann text",
        respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.[citation needed]

        The story reflects Wells's own socialist political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary
        angst about industrial relations. It is also influenced by Ray Lankester's theories about social degeneration[3]
        and shares many elements with Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Vril, the Power of the Coming Race (1871).[4] Other
        science fiction works of the period, including Edward Bellamy's novel Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) and the
        later film Metropolis (1927), dealt with similar themes.[citation needed]

        This work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre. The portion of the novella that sees the Time
        Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places The Time Machine within the realm of
        Eschatology, i.e. the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.

        The book's protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, in Victorian
        England, and identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. The narrator recounts the Traveller's
        lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension, and his demonstration of a tabletop
        model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person
        through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.

        In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to A.D. 802,701, where
        he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large
        and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to
        communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a
        peaceful, communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving
        to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival.

        Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing, and
        eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors,
        locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving
        it. Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness
        underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes
        the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two
        species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become
        the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the
        Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His
        revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants, but of livestock and ranchers. The
        Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges
        facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.

        Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight,
        and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with
        him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh
        supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He
        plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much
        for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The
        Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a
        forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his
        loss.

        The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that
        he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years
        from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like
        creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple
        lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and
        the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living
        things die out.

        Overwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to Victorian time, arriving at his laboratory just three
        hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors,
        producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator then takes
        over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another
        journey. After promising to return in a short period of time, the narrator reveals that after 3 years of
        waiting, the Time Traveller has never returned.
